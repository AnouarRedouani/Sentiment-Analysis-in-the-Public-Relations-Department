# Case Study: Sentiment Analysis in the Public Relations Department

## Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automate sentiment analysis of customer reviews. By analyzing data collected from social media platforms and other sources, the goal is to determine whether customers are satisfied or not. This initiative aims to enhance customer experience and streamline feedback evaluation.

## Objectives
1. **Understand the Problem Statement and Business Case**: Analyze challenges of manual sentiment analysis and explore scalable NLP solutions.
2. **Data Preparation**: Import libraries and datasets, followed by data exploration and cleaning.
3. **Text Processing**: Handle text data, including punctuation removal, stop word elimination, and tokenization (CountVectorization).
4. **Machine Learning Models**: Apply Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers to predict sentiment.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and refine the approach for better accuracy.

## Key Features
1. **Task-Based Learning**:
   - Task 1: Understand the problem statement and business case.
   - Tasks 2-4: Import libraries, explore datasets, and clean data.
   - Tasks 5-7: Remove punctuation, eliminate stop words, and tokenize text.
   - Task 8: Apply text preprocessing techniques.
   - Tasks 9-10: Implement Naive Bayes classifiers.
   - Task 11: Evaluate the trained modelâ€™s performance.
   - Task 12: Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier as an alternative.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Convert textual data into numerical formats for machine learning.
3. **Sentiment Classification**: Automate identification of positive or negative customer sentiment.
4. **Practical Insights**: Highlight the value of automating feedback analysis for large-scale data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For text data processing and analysis.
- **NLP Libraries**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn for Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
- **Visualization Tools**: Seaborn and Matplotlib for data patterns and model performance.

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Automated Sentiment Analysis**: Reduce reliance on manual reviews using machine learning.
2. **Customer Insights**: Understand satisfaction trends to improve products and services.
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare effectiveness of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers.
4. **Skill Development**: Gain expertise in text data handling and machine learning applications.
